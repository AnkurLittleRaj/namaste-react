2nd episode
There are 2 types of dependencies:-
1>Dev Dependencies
 dev dependencies are dependencies that used at time of development.
 for example :-
 we need parcel to bundle,minify our code . so we install parcel at time of developement.
npm i -D parcel

2>Normal Dependencies

Normal dependencies are dependencies that are used in production also

------------
sometime when we do install package we get something like this

    "parcel": "^2.9.2"
  ^ this is called caret.
  so it means currently it is 2.9.2 in package and in future if minor upgrade (2.9.3) version will be there in npm ,
  it will automatically upgrade in package.json



  ----------------------------
  sometime in package.json we get ~ with pacage, it known as tilde
     "xyz": "~2.9.2"

  so in future if major upgrade (3.x.x) version will be there in npm ,
  it will automatically upgrade to major version in package.json



  -----------------------------------------
  package.lock.json 
  it keeps record of exact version of package inside our app.
  so package.json can have ^ or ~ with package version but package-lock.json will tell exact verion
  for ex:-
     "parcel": {
      "version": "2.9.2",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/parcel/-/parcel-2.9.2.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-nTpT/0JIhGW5rKXVnVGHyLBFK/KxteqzsSjQNzeGybiBttnIYRXnM03e2QJX0GWqiS9OtM4rJro04DNHoqx3Ug==",
     }
"integrity" --> it have hash as value which keeps package same in local(machine) and prod



---------------------------

npx --> its a command to execute package
example --
when we write npx parcel index.html

so npx will execute parcel package and parcel will start doing its work and use index.html
-------------------

import or export can't be used in normal js file

to use import or export we have to tell type="module"
