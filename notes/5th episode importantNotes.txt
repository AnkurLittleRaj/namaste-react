Two Types of export/import

- Default Export/import
export default Component;
import Component from "path";



-Named Export/Import
export const Component;

import {Component} from "path";


    REACT HOOKS
--------------------------

 useState :-
  so suppose if there is something change happening in List or something in code and we want our DOM also
  to be updated (like interpolation in Angular ) , so we can use useState hook provided by react.

  so initialy we have to give some default values(see in code)
  and then use setListname to update the value and that value will render in UI



Whenever state variable get updated, react will rerender the Component
and update the DOM.

Reconciliation Algorithm

---------------------
React uses this algorithm.
This Reconciliation Algorithm is also known as React Fiber.



Virtual DOM - Representation of actual DOM

To understand this let's take example

So let say we have 7 restraunt card list and on button click we are filtering the list 
and 3 Restraunt card is showing.

so how react is doing this?
so first react is creating a virtual Dom which is nothing but an object 
. so we have now virtual Dom containing 7 restraunt card.

Now when button clicked , now new virtual dom is created with 3 card list.
Now there comes concept of Diff Algorithm(explain below).
this diff algorithm then decides what to update in the real DOM.



   Diff Algorithm
   ----------------

Diff Algorithm is algorithm in which virtual doms are compared
as these are objects and then based on comparison the real DOM get modified and displayed in UI.
